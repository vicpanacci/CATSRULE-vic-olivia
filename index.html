        <h2>Why are cats so cute?</h2>
        <p>Before we get into the specifics of cat cuteness, let’s talk about what “cute” means in general. If you look it up on Wikipedia, there’s actually a recognized set of characteristics that determine “cute,” all fitting under the German word kinderschema (source). They are:
        <ul>	• Big, forward-facing eyes</ul>
        <ul>	• Rounded ears</ul>
        <ul>	• Floppy limbs and unstable movements</ul>
        <ul>	• Soft, rounded body shape</ul>
        <ul>	• A large head compared to the rest of their body</ul>
        <p> babies are the original source of these characteristics. Scientists theorize that appearing soft, vulnerable, and loveable is an evolutionary adaptation that ensures survival. In other words, babies are cute so that adults will take care of them!</p>
        <p> it’s not just human babies who trigger our caretaking instincts; kittens, puppies, lambs, and other baby animals make us feel the same way. And so do adult mammals who retain their “kinderschema.”There’s a scientific term for that, too: neoteny, or “the retention of juvenile features in the adult animal.”</p>
       <p>Of course, not all adult cats have big heads or round eyes. But most of them have soft, rounded body shapes. They have fur that’s pleasing to touch. They make high-pitched, baby-like meows and comforting, rumbly purrs. Cats are chock full of cute characteristics that make humans want to take care of them.</p>

        <h2> Cat Personality Index</h2>
        <p>Researchers based out the University of South Australia have created a personality index for cats. The team laid out the "Feline Five" of traits forming a cat's personality: neuroticism, extraversion, , impulsiveness, and agreeableness. </p>
        <p>Neuroticism- reflects strongest levels of traits, such as insecure, anxious, fearful of people, suspicious and shy; (2) Dominance- reflects bullying, dominant and aggressive to other cats; (3) Impulsiveness- reflects impulsive, erratic and reckless; and (4) Agreeableness- reflects affectionate, friendly to people and gentle. However, our fifth factor Extraversion also revealed traits normally associated with Self-control in Scottish wildcats including decisive, aimless, persevering and quitting.</p>

        <h2> Why do Cats Purr?</h2>
        <p>Cats purr because they have something to say, which roughly translated is “please keep still and pay attention to me.” Kittens purr to persuade their mothers to keep on nursing them, and pet cats purr when they want to be stroked. The vibrations emanating from the purr certainly have a calming effect on people. Yet sick cats will also purr as a cry for help. So purring doesn’t always mean “I’m happy.” Some researchers have claimed that the vibrations from purring might help heal bone damage in an injured cat. </p>

      <h2>How did Cats get so Cute?</h2>
     <p>Some people think cats may have evolved to be cuter as they became domesticated in order to make people want to take care of them more. It makes sense, doesn’t it, that cats would become increasingly cute as they became increasingly dependent on human beings to survive?</p>
     <p>, if you’ve lived with a cat, you know that sometimes their features can be downright brooding! So why are cats so cute, even if they aren’t wide-eyed and round-featured?</p>
     <p> possible answer: conditioning. Humans have been living alongside cats for hundreds of years. At this point, we’re used to thinking of them as cute, even the ones who are less baby-faced. In fact, according to British anthrozoologist John Bradshaw, author of the book Cat Sense, cats’ “rather unexpressive faces” may make humans want to protect them even more.</p>
     <p> counterintuitive? Bradshaw says it’s all about projection: we humans come up with our own ideas about what a cat is thinking or feeling (source). And for many people, living in a society that values pets and makes cute cat videos go viral all the time, we often project vulnerability.In other words, cats are cute because humans decided they were cute.</p></section>
